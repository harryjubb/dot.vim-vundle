This is a vim configuration directory, set up to use Vundle
(https://github.com/gmarik/vundle) to manage packages. Clone it using

```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/jgtate/dot.vim-vundle.git
```

to retrieve Vundle along with everything else.

To integrate vim and tmux, make sure the file `bin/tmux-vim-select-pane` is
on your path and add the key bindings in `tmux.conf`.
